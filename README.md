This branch is specifically ffor NOvA with NA61 60 GeV Reweighter. We have removed MIPP and introduced SVD decomposition for NA61 data.
There is a new mode: scripts/inputa_na61.xml, this will allow to switch on NA61 reweighter.
The NA49 simulations are also for the Geant4 v_10.4, earlier v9.2 was used.
